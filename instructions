Problem: Movie Recommendation App

You are tasked with building a movie recommendation app that allows users to
 discover movies based on their preferences and ratings. The app should provide
  a list of movies, allow users to rate movies, and recommend new movies based
   on their ratings.

Requirements:

    Display a list of movies: Fetch a list of movies from an API endpoint (you can
     use mock data or create a simple JSON file) and display them in a visually
     appealing way. Each movie should have fields like title, description, genre,
      and average rating.

    User authentication: Implement a user authentication system where users can sign up,
     sign in, and sign out. Use any authentication method you are comfortable with
      (e.g., email/password, OAuth).

    Movie ratings: Allow authenticated users to rate movies on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.
     Users should be able to rate a movie only once and update their rating if desired.
      Display the average rating for each movie based on user ratings.

    Personalized movie recommendations: Based on a user's ratings, provide personalized
    movie recommendations. Recommend movies that have high average ratings from users with
     similar preferences.

    Search and filtering: Implement a search functionality that allows users to search for
    movies by title, genre, or any other relevant criteria. Additionally, provide filtering
    options to sort movies by rating or genre.

    Responsive Design: Ensure the app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

You are expected to write the frontend code using React and any necessary components, state
 management (e.g., useState, useReducer), and other techniques you deem appropriate. The focus
  of this problem is on the complexity of the domain and implementing advanced features
   like user authentication and personalized recommendations.

It's recommended to structure your code in a modular and reusable manner, following best
practices for React development. Feel free to style the app using CSS or a UI library of your choice.

During the interview, you will be evaluated based on the quality of your code, your ability
 to architect and implement the required functionality, and your attention to detail.
 Be prepared to explain your code decisions and walk through your implementation.
